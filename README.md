# Project Guidelines
The reasons we created this project guidelines was to smooth our development. The good guidelines can do
- Standardizing, the same standards use on projects helps our team members can understand projects quick and reduces learning curse to join projects. 
- Automating, we created project-generating scripts to generate projects based on our standards.
- Improving qualities, we force projects to have lint rules and test. Also, we add git pre-commit hook for projects to run lint and test to make sure projects step high qualities.

These guidelines have accelerated our development. Hence, we shared these guidelines to you. We hope them can accelerate your development as well.
